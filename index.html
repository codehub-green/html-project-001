                            it has 20″ center-lock alloy wheels, a Shark Werks exhaust system, a front-axle lift system, LED headlights with PDLS, the Chrono Package, a rear spoiler, a back-up camera, carbon-fiber full bucket seats, PCM with navigation,

                            The 991 GT3 featured revised front and rear bumper covers when compared to the standard Carrera as well as a rear wing and dual center-exit exhaust pipes. 
                            This example is finished in GT Silver Metallic and has LED headlights with Porsche Dynamic Lighting System (PDLS), a back-up camera, body-color side skirts, and LED taillights. 
                            Paint protection film has been applied to the exterior, per the seller.

                            The 20″ center-lock alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. Braking is handled by red Porsche-branded calipers over dimpled and ventilated discs, and the car is equipped with a front-axle lift system. 
                            A brake fluid flush was performed in March 2024.

                            The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Alcantara inserts, while carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. Contrasting stitching extends from the seats to the dashboard, center console, and door panels, 
                            and additional appointments include Porsche Communication Management with navigation as well as a Bose sound system, automatic climate control, carbon-fiber illuminated door sill guards, the Light Design Package, and cruise control.

                            The three-spoke Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer as well as a 225-mph speedometer, an LCD screen, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. 
                            A stopwatch is mounted atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership.

                            The 4.0-liter flat-six was factory rated at 500 horsepower and 339 lb-ft of torque. The car was optioned with an extended range 23.7-gallon fuel tank. 
                            An oil change was performed in March 2024, at which time the drive belt, air filters, and spark plugs were replaced.
