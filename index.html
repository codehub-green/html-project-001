                            The 20″ center-lock alloy wheels are mounted with Pirelli P Zero tires. Braking is handled by red Porsche-branded calipers over dimpled and ventilated discs, and the car is equipped with a front-axle lift system.

                            The carbon-fiber full bucket seats are trimmed in black leather with Alcantara inserts, while carbon-fiber trim accents the cabin. Contrasting stitching extends from the seats to the dashboard, center console, and door panels,

                            The three-spoke Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel frames a central GT3-branded tachometer as well as a 225-mph speedometer, an LCD screen, and gauges for oil pressure, oil temperature, coolant temperature, and fuel level. 
                            A stopwatch is mounted atop the dashboard. The digital odometer indicates 8k miles, approximately 4k of which were added under current ownership.
